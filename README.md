I'm from Brazil, I'm 36 and I have been work with development since 2019.
I really enjoy learn more, studying something new that can help my job on the projects that I am involved, help team members, giving some feedback or learn with them.
Currently I am a front-end developer working with React.js, TS and libraries like Redux, Styled Components, Material UI, Jest (Unit Tests and Cypress (E2E Tests) and I am studying Software Architecture to achieve a knowledge on back-end stuff, and gain more knowledge on how all the things since the scratch works or should work.
I am studing Node.js with Nest.js and Java SpringBoot.


Skills: React / JS / TypeScript / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Domo Inc. as Front-end Software Engineer https://www.domo.com/
